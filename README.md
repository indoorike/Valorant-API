# Valorant-API
Using Valorant's API to build a clone of the agent information page


I built this project to solidify my understanding of how APIs work, and how the communication happens between the front and backend parts of a web application. 
This was a great learning expereince as it was my first step into becoming more of a full-stack developer. 

The project works by reading data from the agent endpoint of Riot Games' REST API, and displaying it to the screen. Different parts of the JSON object are read to display character descriptions, ability descriptions, and character roles. 
Created with vanilla JS, html, and CSS. A fun functionality is of the project is being able to scroll through different agents, rather than just displaying a static list.
This is accomplished by using simple JS events to handle calculate the distance of the mouse to the parent container. 

Have fun!
